I used to be someone who could handle challenges, but now I feel like I'm losing a battle against my own mind every single day. The worst part is the isolation and emptiness that follows me everywhere, making me question if there's any purpose to continuing this fight. My family tries to understand, but I can see the worry and helplessness in their eyes when they look at me, which only adds to my guilt about being such a burden.

The weather was clear and visibility was good, making for safe driving conditions. Once I arrived at the office, I grabbed my laptop bag and headed up to the third floor where my desk is located.

The hypomanic episodes can feel amazing in the moment, like I'm finally the person I'm supposed to be, productive and full of ideas and ambition. But by this afternoon, I could feel the familiar crash beginning as my mood started to shift downward. Now I'm sitting here feeling exhausted and empty, looking at all the unfinished projects I started with such enthusiasm just hours ago. It's frustrating because I know this pattern so well, yet I still get caught up in the highs and devastated by the lows. My medication helps stabilize me most of the time, and my therapist has given me tools to recognize these mood swings, but some days I still feel like I'm on an emotional roller coaster that I can't get off. I'm grateful for the treatment and support I have, but I also mourn the person I might have been without this constant battle in my brain. üé¢üíäüòî‚ú®"
